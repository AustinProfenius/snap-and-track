Below is a lean but scalable schema‑and‑storage blueprint. It keeps “reference” data (rarely changes) separate from “event” data (logs that grow daily) and adds a couple of tables you’ll likely need once you reach production.

1 ⃣ Reference / system tables
(small, read‑often, almost never deleted)

Table	Purpose	Key fields
users	account & profile	user_id PK, name, email, onboarding_date, unit_pref, goal_kcal, goal_water_ml, etc.
foods	USDA / OpenFoodFacts catalog	food_id PK, description, brand, default_portion_grams, kcal_100g, protein_g_100g…
exercises	canonical list	exercise_id PK, name, primary_muscle, equipment, icon_url
images (optional)	meta for CDN assets if you don’t embed URL directly	image_id PK, exercise_id FK, url, width, height, mime
nutrients	dictionary of nutrient_ids (USDA)	nutrient_id PK, name, unit

👉 Indexes: PK‑only; maybe a GIN trigram index on foods.description for search.

2 ⃣ Transactional / event tables
(append‑only, partition by month or user for speed)

Table	What it stores	Key columns
workouts	one workout session	workout_id PK, user_id FK, start_ts, end_ts, total_kcal
workout_sets	every logged set	set_id PK, workout_id FK, exercise_id FK, set_no, weight_kg, reps, rpe, ts
meals	every eating occasion	meal_id PK, user_id FK, meal_type ENUM(breakfast,lunch,dinner,snack), ts
meal_items	each food in a meal	meal_item_id PK, meal_id FK, food_id FK, portion_grams, kcal
water_intake	water logs	entry_id PK, user_id FK, ml, ts
daily_summaries (materialized view / cron job)	1 row per user per day	user_id, date, kcal_in, kcal_out, protein_g, water_ml, …
goals (optional)	long‑term targets	goal_id PK, user_id FK, type(kcal,weight,biceps_cm…), target_value, target_date
devices / tokens (optional)	auth & push	device_id PK, user_id, refresh_token, push_token

👉 Partition suggestions

Edit
workout_sets     →  RANGE (ts)  OR  HASH (user_id)
meal_items       →  same
water_intake     →  same
3 ⃣ Storage tech stack
Layer	Recommended tech	Why
Transactional DB	PostgreSQL (cloud‑hosted)	Strong relational links, JSONB if you need flex fields, good partitioning / analytics extensions.
Cache / offline sync	SQLite/Room on device	Local queries when offline; sync up via REST when back online.
File / image storage	S3 + CloudFront (or Firebase Storage)	Cheap, versionable CDN.
Analytics	Postgres → Materialized views → Superset / Metabase	Simple first; graduate to ClickHouse or BigQuery if you exceed 100 M rows.

4 ⃣ Core API endpoints
sql
Copy
Edit
GET  /catalog/foods?search=apple          → foods table
GET  /catalog/exercises?muscle=biceps     → exercises table
POST /workouts                            → insert workouts + sets
POST /nutrition/meals                     → insert meals + items
POST /hydration                           → insert water_intake
GET  /history/workouts?from=...&to=...    → joins workouts ←→ exercises
GET  /summary/daily?date=YYYY-MM-DD       → daily_summaries view
All payloads carry the stable IDs (food_id, exercise_id) so the client never ships actual names.

5 ⃣ What you were missing (commonly added later)
Table / concept	Why you’ll want it
meal_types ENUM	enforces Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snack consistency
goals / streaks	user motivation, notifications (“hit 2 L water 5 days straight!”)
units table	if you support oz/lb + ml/kg, easier than hard‑coding
audit_log	GDPR / HIPAA style access logs
email_verification & password_reset	auth flows

TL;DR
Keep reference data small and immutable (foods, exercises, icons).
Log everything the user does in append‑only event tables (workout_sets, meal_items, water_intake).
Summarize nightly into daily_summaries for quick dashboard reads.

PostgreSQL with monthly partitioning will scale comfortably into the tens of millions of rows, and its JSONB columns give you NoSQL‑style flexibility if an exercise someday needs extra metadata.
