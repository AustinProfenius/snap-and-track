# Snap and Track - Development Strategy

## Overall Approach: UI-First Development

We'll implement the app in the following phases:

1. **UI and Navigation Framework** - Build all screens with placeholder data and temporary navigation
2. **Backend Services and Database Design** - Implement backend services and database structure
3. **Feature Integration** - Connect UI with backend functionality
4. **Polish and Testing** - Improve UX/UI details and thoroughly test all features

- [ ] Fix bugs and issues

### 4.4 Deployment
- [ ] Configure app for production
- [ ] Generate app icons and splash screens
- [ ] Prepare store listings
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Progress Tracking

We'll track our progress by:
1. Checking off tasks in this document as they're completed
2. Creating a TaskMaster task for each major component
3. Using GitHub issues for bug tracking
4. Conducting regular progress reviews

This UI-first approach will allow us to maintain a clear visual understanding of the app's functionality while systematically implementing each feature.
