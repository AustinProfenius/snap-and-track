# Expo Connection Issue Resolution

## Problem
The Expo Go app on the iOS simulator was unable to connect to the Metro bundler running on the host machine. This resulted in:
- Timeouts when trying to load the app in Expo Go
- Error messages like "Unknown error: The request timed out"
- The app not loading despite Metro bundler running correctly

## Symptoms
- Metro bundler was running successfully at `exp://10.5.0.2:8081` (or similar IP)
- The simulator's Safari browser could access both ports 8081 and 19000 directly
- Expo Go could not connect to the Metro bundler and would timeout
- The app would get stuck on "Opening project..." or show "There was a problem running the requested app"

## Troubleshooting Steps Tried
1. Clearing Expo caches (`rm -rf ~/.expo`)
2. Resetting the simulator ("Erase All Content and Settings")
3. Killing all node processes and restarting Metro
4. Checking network connectivity between simulator and Mac
5. Updating macOS and development tools
6. Changing the project configuration in app.json
7. Trying different ports (8081, 19000)

## Solution
The solution that worked was using `localhost` instead of the IP address for the Metro bundler. Specifically:

```bash
EXPO_DEVTOOLS_LISTEN_ADDRESS=localhost npx expo start --localhost
```

This forces Metro to bind to localhost and makes Expo Go connect via localhost instead of using the machine's IP address.

## Why This Worked
When using an IP address, there can be various networking issues:
- Firewall rules may block connections to specific IPs but allow localhost
- Network interface binding issues
- DNS resolution problems
- Routing issues between the simulator and host machine

Using localhost bypasses these issues by using the loopback interface which is more reliable for simulator-to-host communication.

## Implementing This Solution Permanently

### Option 1: Update package.json Scripts
Edit the `package.json` file in the SnapAndTrackV3 directory to include the environment variable:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "EXPO_DEVTOOLS_LISTEN_ADDRESS=localhost expo start --localhost",
  "android": "EXPO_DEVTOOLS_LISTEN_ADDRESS=localhost expo start --android --localhost",
  "ios": "EXPO_DEVTOOLS_LISTEN_ADDRESS=localhost expo start --ios --localhost",
  "web": "EXPO_DEVTOOLS_LISTEN_ADDRESS=localhost expo start --web --localhost"
}
```

### Option 2: Create a .env File
Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
EXPO_DEVTOOLS_LISTEN_ADDRESS=localhost
```

### Option 3: Create an Alias or Shell Script
Create a shell script in the project root called `start-expo.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
EXPO_DEVTOOLS_LISTEN_ADDRESS=localhost npx expo start --localhost "$@"
```

Make it executable with `chmod +x start-expo.sh` and run it with `./start-expo.sh` or `./start-expo.sh --ios`.

## Future Troubleshooting
If this issue recurs:
1. Check if Safari in the simulator can access the Metro bundler port directly
2. Try different binding options (localhost, LAN IP, etc.)
3. Check for firewall rules or network changes
4. Consider using Expo's tunnel option if localhost doesn't work
